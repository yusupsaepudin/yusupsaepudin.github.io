        <h1>Kamran Ahmed</h1>
        <p class="about__head">
            Lead Engineer at <a href="http://tajawal.com" target="_blank">tajawal</a></strong>. Tech guy with an
            entrepreneurial spirit and knack for getting things done.
        </p>

        <div class="about__description">
            <p>With 5+ years of experience on my back, I am a seasoned developer with a demonstrated history of working
                upon large scale enterprise level applications. Having delivered several solutions for the domains
                including Business management and ERPs, educational platforms, finance, healthcare and leisure industry,
                I have gained hands-on experience in all stages of enterprise application development along with the
                ability to understand customer needs, communicate effectively and adapting well to changes in workplace
                environments. Turning ideas into real world solutions is my key strength, which compliments my love for
                learning new technologies and solving challenging problems. I always try to make a positive impact in
                the organizations I work at, both from a technical and interpersonal perspective.</p>

            <p>I am a forward-thinker by nature, love to to code and always open to learning new stuff. A full-stack
                veteran, a wearer of different many hats, who isn't bound by what he knows and takes solace from
                getting to walk across the borders and experience the other unknown territories every once in a while.
                I am an Open Source enthusiast and in my spare time, you can find me
                <strong><a href="https://github.com/{{ site.github }}" class="link-github">toying around at GitHub</a></strong>
                or maybe writing sometimes. Technical skill-set has never been a problem for me and I take solace from
                spending my time testing new platforms and technologies.</p>

            <p>Iâ€™m currently in Berlin, where I work as an Engineering Lead for <a href="tajawal.com" target="_blank">Tajawal</a>,
                a venture of Al-Tayyar Group, leading the development of the back-office application and working in the
                core architecture of our platform. I was one of the pre-launch-early hires and I am really proud of what
                we have achieved over the past 2.5 years. I have been the key member of the architecture team and I am a
                major contributor in most of the projects that we have; where I have solely and in-team developed some
                core parts of the whole setup that we have.</p>

            <p>Feel free to reach out if you would like to learn more about me or just say hi, I love stumbling across
                the messages from the strangers in my inbox.</p>
